# snake-game-1.0

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Turtle graphics.

## Introduction

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game screen.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- **Food Generation**: Food appears at random locations on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.
- **High Score**: The game records and displays the highest score achieved by players.
